    <h1> My Favorite Hobby  </h1>
    <h2> Biking </h2>
    <section>
    <p> My hobby is biking outside with my friends in the evening. When ever it's evening I take my bike and I go out. Biking is good because it helps your legs and it is very pratical. It is also a great transportation. Riding a bike helps stop pollution, by riding a bike you are not producing gas. I am 10 and I bike every day for 2 hours. Which means I am getting a lot of execrise by having fun. Which in the end shows that you dont need to have fun by not staying fit.  </p>
